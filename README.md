# Computational Utils

## Description
Some small but useful utilities for your everyday computation:

### Maybe
Some utilities for null safe operation for plain object and collection

### Mappo
A wrapper class for map for better integration between Map and Optional. Also some added capabilities like `findByIds` (you get the idea).
